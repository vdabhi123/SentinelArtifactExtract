When to use this powershell Script:
When this error comes while running the Script "GitHub API rate limit error (403)"

Use GitHub Authentication (Recommended)

Create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT):

Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens

Click “Generate new token (classic)”

Give it a name, expiry, and select scope: ✅ no scopes are needed for public repo access like Sentinel

Generate and copy the token

Once PAT is generated:

Here's your full PowerShell script, updated to:

✅ Authenticate with GitHub using your personal access token (hardcoded securely in script)
✅ Fetch only those Sentinel solutions that have an Analytic Rules folder
✅ Let you interactively select a solution
✅ Export all analytic rule metadata (name, severity, tactics, techniques, etc.)
✅ Handle errors gracefully, including rate limiting
