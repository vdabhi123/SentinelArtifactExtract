To absolutely improve performance by skipping the step where the script scans all solutions first and 
instead just let the user directly input the solution name (even if it's wrong) — then the script will 
attempt to pull that specific solution’s Analytic Rules.

saving a lot of time and avoiding hitting rate limits.
