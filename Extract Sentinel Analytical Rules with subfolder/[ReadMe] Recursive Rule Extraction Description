The default script checks only the top-level YAML files in Analytic Rules. 
But many solutions‚Äîlike Microsoft Defender XDR‚Äîhave nested subfolders like:
Solutions/Microsoft Defender XDR/Analytic Rules/Campaign/Jupyter-Solarmaker/Rule.yaml, etc.

We can recursively walk through all subfolders under Analytic Rules to fetch all .yaml files, no matter how deep they are.

üîÅ Updated Script (Recursive Rule Extraction Included)
Here's a fully updated script that:
‚Ä¢	Authenticates with GitHub using your token
‚Ä¢	Prompts you to select a valid solution with an Analytic Rules folder
‚Ä¢	Recursively scans subfolders for YAML rule files
‚Ä¢	Extracts all available rule metadata
‚Ä¢	Exports the results to CSV

üß™ Example Test Case
Try running this for Microsoft Defender XDR, and it will pull rules from:
Solutions/Microsoft Defender XDR/Analytic Rules/
Solutions/Microsoft Defender XDR/Analytic Rules/Campaign/
Solutions/Microsoft Defender XDR/Analytic Rules/Campaign/Jupyter-Solarmaker/
